If this is true, then an essential part of the language of mathematics is numbers.Doing so made commerce possible, leading to improved communications and the spread of civilization.Three to four thousand years ago, Egyptians introduced fractions.They first used them to show reciprocals.Later, they used them to represent the amount when a quantity was divided into equal parts.The natural numbers are, of course, also called the counting numbers.Any time we enumerate the members of a team, count the coins in a collection, or tally the trees in a grove, we are using the set of natural numbers.Write each of the following rational numbers as either a terminating or repeating decimal.A builder, for instance, may have found that the diagonal of a square with unit sides was not 2 or even 3 2 , 3 2 , but was something else.Such numbers are said to be irrational because they cannot be written as fractions.We refer to this as the real number line as shown in Figure 1.The set of natural numbers includes the numbers used for counting: { 1,2,3,... }. { 1,2,3,... }.Classify each number as being a natural number (N), whole number (W), integer (I), rational number (Q), and/or irrational number (Q′).For example, 4 2 =4⋅4=16.In general, the exponential notation a n a n means that the number or variable a a is used as a factor n n times.In this notation, a n a n is read as the nth power of a, a, or aa to the nn where a a is called the base and n n is called the exponent.For instance, there may be a radical expression inside parentheses that must be simplified before the parentheses are evaluated.Use the order of operations to evaluate each of the following expressions.We can better see this relationship when using real numbers.Again, consider an example with real numbers.For example, 17−5 17−5 is not the same as 5−17. 5−17. Similarly, 20÷5≠5÷20. 20÷5≠5÷20.The associative property of multiplication tells us that it does not matter how we group numbers when multiplying.Now, distribute −1 −1 and simplify the result.The inverse property of addition states that, for every real number a, there is a unique number, called the additive inverse (or opposite), denoted by (−a), that, when added to the original number, results in the additive identity, 0.State which properties apply.State which properties apply.In mathematics, we may see expressions such as x+5, 4 3 π r 3 , x+5, 4 3 π r 3 , or 2 m 3 n 2 .In the expression x+5, x+5, 5 is called a constant because it does not vary and x is called a variable because it does.The values that make the equation true, the solutions, are found using the properties of real numbers and other results.A right circular cylinder with radius r r and height h h has the surface area S S (in square units) given by the formula S=2πr( r+h ).The surface area is 180π 180π square inches.The area of the mat (in square centimeters, or cm2) is found to be A=( L+16 )( W+16 )−L⋅W.See Figure 4.Find the area of a mat for a photograph with length 32 cm and width 24 cm.For the following exercises, solve for the variable.For the following exercises, solve the given problem.Jessica put her loose change in the jar first, and then Adriana put her change in the jar.What property of addition describes this fact?Throughout the day, 400 pounds of gravel is added to the mound.Two orders of 600 pounds are sold and the gravel is removed from the mound.The division of two natural numbers will always result in what type of number?Step 1.Step 4.A=π r 2 .S=2πr( r+h ).How could someone indicate the existence of nothing?In this section, we will explore sets of numbers, calculations with different kinds of numbers, and the use of numbers in expressions.The set of integers adds the opposites of the natural numbers to the set of whole numbers: { ...,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,... }. { ...,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,... }.In this sense, the positive integers are just the natural numbers.Notice from the definition that rational numbers are fractions (or quotients) containing integers in both the numerator and the denominator, and the denominator is never 0.Therefore it is neither a terminating nor a repeating decimal and, hence, not a rational number.Each subset includes fractions, decimals, and irrational numbers according to their algebraic sign (+ or –).We refer to this as the real number line as shown in Figure 1.Does the number lie to the left or the right of 0 on the number line?It lies to the right of 0.To evaluate a mathematical expression, we perform the various operations.The next step is to address any exponents or radicals.Following the order of operations ensures that anyone simplifying the same mathematical expression will get the same result.Simplify any expressions within grouping symbols. Step 2.Perform any multiplication and division in order, from left to right. Step 4.Note that 4 is outside the grouping symbols, so we distribute the 4 by multiplying it by 12, multiplying it by –7, and adding the products.Inverse Properties The inverse property of addition states that, for every real number a, there is a unique number, called the additive inverse (or opposite), denoted by (−a), that, when added to the original number, results in the additive identity, 0.State which properties apply.In the expression x+5, x+5, 5 is called a constant because it does not vary and x is called a variable because it does.We have already seen some real number examples of exponential notation, a shorthand method of writing products of the same factor.The expressions can be numerical or algebraic.The equation is not inherently true or false, but only a proposition.The values that make the equation true, the solutions, are found using the properties of real numbers and other results.For example, the equation 2x+1=7 2x+1=7 has the solution of 3 because when we substitute 3 for x x in the equation, we obtain the true statement 2( 3 )+1=7.A formula is an equation expressing a relationship between constant and variable quantities.S=2πr( r+h ).See Figure 3.Find the surface area of a cylinder with radius 6 in.Leave the answer in terms of π. π.Figure 3 Right circular cylinder Solution Evaluate the expression 2πr( r+h ) 2πr( r+h ) for r=6 r=6 and h=9. h=9.S = 2πr(r+h) = 2π(6)[(6)+(9)] = 2π(6)(15) = 180π S = 2πr(r+h) = 2π(6)[(6)+(9)] = 2π(6)(15) = 180π The surface area is 180π 180π square inches.Example 12 Simplifying Algebraic Expressions Simplify each algebraic expression.What is the order of operations?What acronym is used to describe the order of operations, and what does it stand for? 3.What do the Associative Properties allow us to do when following the order of operations?Explain your answer.Numeric For the following exercises, simplify the given expression. 4.For the 8( 2+4 )−15b+b 8( 2+4 )−15b+b for b=–3 b=–3 35.He spends $10 on mp3s, puts half of what is left in a savings account, and gets another $5 for washing his neighbor’s car. 53.Write the expression that represents the number of dollars Fred keeps (and does not put in his savings account).Remember the order of operations. 54.Is the circumference of a quarter a whole number, a rational number, or an irrational number? 56.For the following exercise, solve the given problem. 59.Ramon runs the marketing department at his company.His department gets a budget every year, and every year, he must spend the entire budget without going over.If he spends less than the budget, then his department gets a smaller budget the following year.At the beginning of this year, Ramon got $2.5 million for the annual marketing budget.Evaluate algebraic expressions.It is often said that mathematics is the language of science.The earliest use of numbers occurred 100 centuries ago in the Middle East to count, or enumerate items. Farmers, cattlemen, and tradesmen used tokens, stones, or markers to signify a single quantity—a sheaf of grain, a head of livestock, or a fixed length of cloth, for example.Doing so made commerce possible, leading to improved communications and the spread of civilization.Three to four thousand years ago, Egyptians introduced fractions.They first used them to show reciprocals.Later, they used them to represent the amount when a quantity was divided into equal parts.But what if there were no cattle to trade or an entire crop of grain was lost in a flood?How could someone indicate the existence of nothing?From earliest times, people had thought of a “base state” while counting and used various symbols to represent this null condition.However, it was not until about the fifth century A.D.Clearly, there was also a need for numbers to represent loss or debt.In India, in the seventh century A.D., negative numbers were used as solutions to mathematical equations and commercial debts.The opposites of the counting numbers expanded the number system even further.Because of the evolution of the number system, we can now perform complex calculations using these and other categories of real numbers.In this section, we will explore sets of numbers, calculations with different kinds of numbers, and the use of numbers in expressions.Classifying a Real Number The numbers we use for counting, or enumerating items, are the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
